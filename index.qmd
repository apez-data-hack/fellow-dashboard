Welcome to [Hack.Diversity's](https://www.hackdiversity.com) internal home page. The purpose of this site and pages is to be enable Hack.Diversity to become a more self-service data organization where Team members can go from ideation, validation, and proposal without needing to go through gatekeepers. 

Access the following: 

- [Application Data](applications.html) 
- [Cohort Data](cohorts.html)
- [Current Fellow Dashboard](dashboard.html)
- [Partner Data](partners.html)

Please note that this is a new thing and a work in progress. I hope you find the information useful and if you have any comments or suggestions, please share those with me and the whole team [here](https://forms.gle/iRfne1AJM5BpbmV67).
